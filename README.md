Hulu Clone Website Project

Overview

This project is a responsive Hulu clone website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the look and feel of a streaming service platform, featuring sections for a hero header, subscription plans, content categories, live TV, live sports, and a footer with navigation links. The website includes a modal for user login and is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly across various devices.
Features

Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries for desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
Interactive Modal: A login modal (modal) that appears on clicking the login button (login-btn) and closes via a close button (close) or outside click.
Sections:
Header: Hero section (header) with a background image, logo, and call-to-action buttons (btn, btn-outline) for starting a free trial.
Sub-Header: Promotes bundling with Disney+ and ESPN+ (sub-header) with a call-to-action (btn-dark).
Categories: Showcases TV shows, movies, Hulu Originals, and premiums (categories, covers) with background images.
Live TV: Highlights Hulu + Live TV (live) with a bordered section (live-border).
Live Sports: Displays live sports content (live-sports) with network logos (live-sports-logos).
Footer: Contains navigation links (footer-lists), social media icons (social-icons), and a divider (divider).


Interactive Elements: Hover effects on buttons (btn-cta:hover, btn-outline:hover) and links (a:hover), and a modal animation (modalopen).
External Fonts and Icons: Uses Rubik font from Google Fonts and Font Awesome for icons (not explicitly included in provided HTML).

Technologies Used

HTML5: For semantic structure and content.
CSS3: For styling, responsive design, and animations (e.g., modalopen, gradients like cover-grad).
JavaScript: For modal functionality (script.js) to open, close, and handle outside clicks.
External Resources:
Google Fonts: Rubik (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik:wght@300;400;700&display=swap).
Background Images: Hosted on GitHub (e.g., header.jpg, cover-1.jpg, live-sports.jpg).

index.html: Main HTML file containing the website structure.
style.css: CSS file for styling, including layout, typography, and responsive design.
script.js: JavaScript file for modal functionality.
img/: Directory for images (e.g., header.jpg, cover-1.jpg, live-sports.jpg, network-logo-bg.png).
Note: Ensure images are downloaded from provided GitHub URLs and placed in the img/ folder.



Naming Conventions

Classes:
header, sub-header, categories, live, live-sports, footer: Main sections.
btn, btn-cta, btn-outline, btn-dark: Button styles.
cover-1 to cover-4: Category cover images.

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download:
Clone the repository or download the project files.


File Placement:
Place index.html, style.css, and script.js in the project root.
Create an img/ folder and add required images (download from GitHub URLs, e.g., header.jpg, cover-1.jpg).


Dependencies:
Ensure an internet connection to load Google Fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik:wght@300;400;700&display=swap).
Note: Font Awesome is not included in the provided HTML but may be required for icons if added.


Run the Project:
Open index.html in a web browser to view the website.
No server setup is required as it uses static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



Usage

Navigation: Use the login button (login-btn) in the header to open the login modal (modal).
Modal: Log in using the form (form-control) or close it via the close button (close) or by clicking outside.
Call-to-Actions: Click buttons like "Start Your Free Trial" (btn) or "Get Bundle" (btn-dark) to simulate subscription actions (requires backend integration for functionality).
Responsive Viewing: Test the website on different devices to ensure responsiveness via media queries.

Customization

Styling: Modify style.css to change colors, fonts, or layouts.
Primary color: #fff (white, used for text and buttons).
Accent color: #00ed82 (green, used for headings like h4 and borders like live-border).
Hover color: #ccc (light gray, used for links and buttons).


Content: Update text, images, or links in index.html to match your brand or content.
Images: Replace placeholder images in the img/ folder with your own, ensuring correct paths in style.css.
Animations: Adjust the modal animation (modalopen) or button hover effects (btn-cta:hover, btn-outline:hover) in style.css.
JavaScript: Enhance script.js for additional interactive features (e.g., form validation).

Notes

The login form (form-control) is static and requires backend integration (e.g., PHP, Node.js) for functionality.
Ensure external resources (Google Fonts, images) are accessible, or host them locally if needed.
The project is optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
Font Awesome icons are referenced in the design but not included in the provided HTML; add the Font Awesome CDN (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css) if needed.
Image URLs in style.css (e.g., header.jpg, cover-1.jpg) must be downloaded from GitHub or replaced with local images.
